## üìù Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed:
- ‚úÖ TypeScript for type safety
- ‚úÖ Async/await for promises
- ‚úÖ Error handling with try-catch
- ‚úÖ Loading states for UX
- ‚úÖ Component reusability
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Comments for complex logic
- ‚úÖ Responsive design patterns
- ‚úÖ Accessibility considerations

### Performance Optimizations:
- ‚úÖ useEffect dependencies properly defined
- ‚úÖ Filtered lists computed efficiently
- ‚úÖ Set data structure for O(1) lookups
- ‚úÖ Conditional rendering
- ‚úÖ Debounced search (via state updates)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Pagination**: Currently loads all students (limit: 1000)
   - **Impact**: May be slow with 1000+ students
   - **Solution**: Implement pagination/infinite scroll

2. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket integration
   - **Impact**: Multiple admins may see stale data
   - **Solution**: Add polling or WebSocket support

3. **Undo Functionality**: No undo for enrollment operations
   - **Impact**: Accidental enrollments require manual fix
   - **Solution**: Add undo/redo feature

4. **Mobile Modal**: Fixed height may cut content
   - **Impact**: Very long student lists need scrolling
   - **Solution**: Already implemented with max-h-[80vh]
