## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **File Upload Flow**

```
1. Teacher clicks "Add Resource"
2. Fills form and selects file
3. Frontend creates FormData with file
4. POST /api/v1/resources/modules/{moduleId}
   - Authorization: Bearer {teacher_token}
   - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
   - Body: {resource field, title, description, etc.}
5. Multer middleware processes file
   - Saves to /uploads/resources/
   - Generates unique filename
6. Controller extracts file metadata
   - fileUrl: http://localhost:5000/uploads/resources/uuid-timestamp.pdf
   - fileName: original_name.pdf
   - fileSize: 1048576 (bytes)
   - mimeType: application/pdf
7. Service validates permissions
   - Checks if teacher owns module
   - Creates database record
8. Returns success response
9. Frontend reloads resources list
```

### **API Endpoints Used**

#### **Module Resources**
```typescript
GET    /api/v1/resources/modules/:moduleId
       - List all resources for module
       - Query params: includeHidden, search, type, category

POST   /api/v1/resources/modules/:moduleId
       - Create new resource with file upload
       - Auth: Teacher/Admin
       - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

#### **Resource Operations**
```typescript
GET    /api/v1/resources/:id
       - Get single resource details
       
PATCH  /api/v1/resources/:id/visibility
       - Toggle hide/unhide
       - Body: { isHidden: boolean }
       
DELETE /api/v1/resources/:id
       - Delete resource permanently
```

### **Database Schema**

```prisma
model ModuleResource {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  title         String
  description   String?
  type          ResourceType  // PDF, VIDEO, DOCUMENT, etc.

  fileUrl       String?
  fileName      String?
  fileSize      Int?
  mimeType      String?
  externalUrl   String?
  
  moduleId      String?
  topicId       String?
  lessonId      String?

  isHidden      Boolean  @default(false)
  isPinned      Boolean  @default(false)
  isMandatory   Boolean  @default(false)
  
  viewCount     Int  @default(0)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### **Current Limitations**
1. **File Size**: Limited to 10MB per file
   - **Solution**: Can be increased in `upload.ts` middleware

2. **File Types**: Limited set of allowed extensions
   - **Solution**: Add more types to `allowedTypes` regex in `upload.ts`

3. **No Edit**: Can't edit resource after creation
   - **Solution**: Implement PUT endpoint handler (already in backend)

4. **No Bulk Operations UI**: Backend supports it, UI doesn't
   - **Solution**: Add checkbox selection and bulk action buttons

### **Testing Notes**
- ⚠️ Ensure backend server is running on port 5000
- ⚠️ Ensure frontend server is running on port 3000
- ⚠️ Check CORS settings if uploads fail
- ⚠️ Verify `uploads/resources/` directory exists and is writable
