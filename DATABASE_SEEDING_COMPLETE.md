## 🔧 Seed Configuration

### **Package.json Configuration**
```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

### **Run Seed Command:**
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### **Reset DB and Re-seed:**
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

---

## 📁 Seed File Location
```
backend/
  └── prisma/
      └── seed.ts  (223 lines)
```

### **What the Seed File Does:**
1. Creates default users (admin, teacher, student)
2. Hashes passwords with bcrypt
3. Sets up classes and subjects
4. Creates teacher-class assignments
5. Enrolls student in classes
6. Creates sample notice
7. Uses upsert to avoid duplicates

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### **Password Hashing:**
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- Never stored in plain text
- Secure comparison on login

### **Default Credentials:**
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change these passwords in production!

```typescript
// In production, ensure:
1. Admin changes default password immediately
2. Force password change on first login
3. Implement password strength requirements
4. Enable 2FA for admin accounts
5. Regular password rotation policy
```

---

## 🔄 Re-running the Seed

### **If you need to re-seed:**

**Option 1: Safe (keeps existing data)**
```bash
# Seed will skip existing records (upsert)
npx prisma db seed
```

**Option 2: Fresh Start (deletes all data)**
```bash
# This will delete everything and re-seed
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

---

## 📈 Next Steps After Seeding

### **1. Test Login Endpoints**
```bash
# Test admin login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@smartschool.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### **2. Create Sample Module**
```bash
# Login first to get token, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/modules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Introduction to Programming",
    "slug": "intro-programming",
    "description": "Learn programming basics",
    "subjectId": "SUBJECT_ID",
    "classId": "CLASS_ID",
    "teacherId": "TEACHER_ID"
  }'
```

### **3. Upload Resources**
```bash
# After creating module:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/resources/modules/MODULE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TEACHER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Chapter 1 Notes",
    "description": "Introduction chapter notes",
    "category": "LECTURE_NOTE",
    "type": "PDF",
    "fileUrl": "https://example.com/chapter1.pdf",

  }'
```

### **4. Test Student Access**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Seed command not found"**
**Solution:** Add prisma.seed to package.json
```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

### **Issue: "Cannot find module bcryptjs"**
**Solution:** Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### **Issue: "Table doesn't exist"**
**Solution:** Run migrations first
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### **Issue: "Unique constraint violation"**
**Solution:** Users already exist, either:
1. Skip (seed uses upsert)
2. Reset DB: `npx prisma migrate reset --force`
